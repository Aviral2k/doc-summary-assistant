## Project Description
The Document Summary Assistant is a tool designed to quickly extract and summarize text from various document formats. Users can upload a PDF or an image of a document (like a scanned page) and receive a short, medium, or long summary of its contents. This project leverages a React frontend for a dynamic user experience and a Node.js backend to handle file processing, text extraction, and communication with the Google Gemini API.

## ‚ú® Key Features
‚Ä¢ Multi-Format Support: Upload and process both PDF and Image files (.png, .jpg).
‚Ä¢ Drag-and-Drop Interface: A modern, intuitive interface for easy file uploads.
‚Ä¢ Smart Summarization: Utilizes the Google Gemini API to generate high-quality, context-aware summaries.
‚Ä¢ Variable Summary Length: Users can choose between short, medium, or long summaries to fit their needs.
‚Ä¢ OCR for Images: Employs Tesseract.js to perform Optical Character Recognition on image-based documents.
‚Ä¢ Responsive Design: A clean and fully responsive UI that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
